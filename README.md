# Disk Scan

This repository contains a simple cross-platform disk scanning tool built with Python and Tkinter. It works on macOS, Windows and Linux.

## Requirements

- Python 3 with Tkinter available (included in standard installations).

## Usage

Run the application with:

```bash
python3 disk_scan.py
```

Click **"Choose Directory"** to select a folder to scan. The tool will draw a radial chart that represents the space taken by items inside that folder. Clicking on any segment shows the path and size for that item.
